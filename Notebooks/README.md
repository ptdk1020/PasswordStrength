### Status
This folder contains several notebooks of data processing and exploration. Numbered from 1 to 4, these notebooks currently need more refinement, and I will need to rerun some of them. At the moment, `Visual_1` is the most complete notebook. 

### Contents
The notebooks are numbered 1 to 4, let us refer to them as `notebook 1` - `notebook 4`.

- `notebook 1` contains preliminary password analysis and visualization. 

- `notebook 2` contains the basic usage of the embedding and clustering. However, currently, the charts are not displayed properly. 

- `notebook 3` contains definition and some visualization of policy compliant passwords. One might run into problems viewing it on Github, but can try [the nbviewer version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ptdk1020/PasswordStrength/blob/pwfeatures/Notebooks/Visual_insights_into_Passwords_3.ipynb).

- `notebook 4` contains my effort in looking at different versions of the embedding as well as different clustering algorithms. Again, it is better to look at [the nbviewer version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ptdk1020/PasswordStrength/blob/pwfeatures/Notebooks/Visual_insights_into_Passwords_4.ipynb).
