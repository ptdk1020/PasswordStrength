## Introduction
### Context
This project is part of the [Accelerated Cybersecurity training program](https://paletteskills.org/programs/cybersecurity-training) offered by Palette Skills and Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences. 

### Goal
Using a dataset of passwords, the project has multiple objectives. Our first goal is to create a visualization dashboard to provide insights into password properties and password topic modelling. Our second goal is to extract password features and provide a prediction algorithm for password strength.
