## Demo Dash application
### Status
The current version is a demo version. The application runs on a development server. Do not use it in production. 

Currently, the app uses data in the form of .csv files. It is better to use databases instead. 

### How to launch
To launch the app in a development server, run `python app.py` in the terminal. 

### Demo Data
The `app.py` uses data from `frame_file` and `reduction_file`. These are by default set to the .csv files in the `demo` folder in the root directory.
